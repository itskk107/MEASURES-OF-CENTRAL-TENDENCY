# MEASURES-OF-CENTRAL-TENDENCY
To summarise data in a clear yet meaningful way, statisticians employ a range of numerical measures or indices. The three measures of central tendency are discussed: Mathematical Average, Positional Average and Special Average.All three metrics specify values that
frequently fall in the middle of a set of data that have been organised in order of magnitude.
They are referred to be measures of central tendency for this reason. The arithmetic mean,
sometimes known as the average, is the most well-known of these metrics. The median and
the mode are measurements that are closely linked. But here we discuss all these three centrals
tendency in details. We also discuss its real-life applications, advantages and disadvantages.
A datasetâ€™s central tendency is a descriptive summary provided by a single number
representing the middle of the data distribution. A branch of descriptive statistics called
central tendency includes the variability (dispersion) of a dataset. One of the fundamental
ideas in statistics is the central tendency. It offers a thorough overview of the whole dataset,
despite without providing information on the specific values in the dataset. In real life it used
widely in various sector like health, insurance, etc
